title: '''What is money?'''
description: '''In this episode, we explored key concepts such as what is a token,
  what is an NFT, what is money and how a coat check works. These elements will help
  understand the design behind blockchain systems. We differentiated between ERC-20/bitcoin
  and ERC-721/NFT, and how they relate to conventional money and coat check systems.
  Get ready for the next week''s workshop!'''
