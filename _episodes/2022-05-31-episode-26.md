<!--end of quick notes-->

- Featuring co-host @vjdeleria
- Spanish NFT community
  - Finance, legal, artist collections
  - Needed to grow: access to technology -> start a collective
  - VjDeleria does: workshops
  - LATAM opportunities:
    - finance / inclusion / 
    - Avalanche / Algorand
- Blockchains with for-profit foundations – Good or bad?
- Blockchain organizations (like Algorand company vs. foundation)
  - Nothing is decentralized // if a project has a website then SOMEBODY is paying for that website and they control it // Hicetnunc project was forked by community
  - Possible models
    - For-profit foundation
    - Corporate sponsorship
    - Wikipedia model – Ask for donations directly from readers
      - Most blockchains have no direct pageviews from participants
    - Red Hat model – free software, charge for support
- 
- Hic Et Nunc case study

- Also, I think this doc should be in chronological order (i.e. the most recent ones should be at the top of the page)
- What is the difference between ERC-721 and ERC-721A?
