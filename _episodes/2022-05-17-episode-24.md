<!--end of quick notes-->

- Special guest https://twitter.com/livingwithwill
- Membership NFTs / utility
  - Discord → gated access
  - Is BAYC a membership club? A gated community?
    - Blockchain provides: permissionless way to interop between airdrops, and other stuff (because owner list is public)
- NFT metadata / is it supposed to not change? @shadowdog
  - So as the owner of an NFT, I should be able to "move" it to a different URI
    - Ok-notokaybears // Solana + ethereum blockchain
- Vitalik's contradictions https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1526378787855736832
- Jared Diamond's Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Survive
