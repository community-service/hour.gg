  - Starting with Xcode / how to open source your first thing. Everything I learned from @CocoaPods @cocoacontrols and stealing their ideas for starting projects. https://youtu.be/WYNYaSp2uX4
  - We found a new error in Xcode 15.3 (regression since 15.2). > The selected package cannot be a direct ancestor of the project. And then we show the workaround for your clean project folder layout. [SCREENSHOT]
  - Do you need to use Xcode every time you make iOS apps? @Rito_Rhymes. No, you can use @appcode and @FastlaneTools. But do you actually need to install Xcode command line stuff? Yes.
