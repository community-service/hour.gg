  - Is this a viable solution? What do you see as possible challenges? 
  - You mentioned adoption as the key blocker for it? Having the solution on Web3 + AI prediction capabilities make it better?
  - Are there any teams that are working on this? What challenges are they facing?

    - Yes, this is a very popular question—it is a top 3 question we get, right next to "what happens if I lose my metamask key?"—other teams that are working on this have been slow to launch. They have all focused on specific industry (fish, drug, …) and not broad.
  - Can this be funded by Ethereum Layer 2 or Near? Should Near be consider for implementation? What are the downsides? I connected with the core team, they are interested in the idea and waiting for details.
    - Easy question: whichever one pays you most. Blockchain adoption is directly related to getting funding.
    - The end customer does not know the difference
    - They are all the same
  - Also looking to find others working on this.

1. Episode 79 on Community Service Hour discussing intelligent supply chain with @thewhyman and how to implement the European backdoor required by the Data Act.

2. Is supply chain a viable application on blockchain? Let's look at some existing applications:

3. The EY solution led by @pbrody is branded specifically after the ESG use case.

   Website is light on details, but EY does host in-person summits that are great if you are a serious candidate for this supply chain tech.

4. @origin_trail is another solution, focused on technology first.

   That website is super buzzwordy, but if you look deep, they are also targeting these same use cases.

5. Now onto the European Data Act and required backdoors for smart contracts. Our main recommendation is that you need to use Gnosis @safe or similar for any backdoor account. This allows you to create separate (and revocable) access for government. This increases accountability and avoids SBF-style "whupps we lost $415M" losses.
