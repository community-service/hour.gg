title: Oracles
subtitle: Can metaverse platforms be connected?
description: "Hadi, a PhD student at Tallinn University in Estonia, is working on using oracles for asset transfer across metaverses. He's exploring the technical requirements and limitations of current oracle solutions as part of his research.\n\nIf you're interested in the intersection of blockchain and metaverse, and if you have insights into oracles, Hadi is seeking more participants for interviews. Creating a Google form could be a method for organizing these interview sessions. \n\nFor those involved in projects or events, consider offering CPR POAPs for added engagement and recognition. Good luck to Hadi on his PhD journey at Tallinn University, and hopefully, the luxury brands onboarding goes smoothly. \n\nAs a side note, remember that having distinct academic departments varies by university, so it may not be applicable to Hadi's situation at the University of Tallinn."
