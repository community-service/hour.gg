- Risks of misuse
  - False flag operations
- “Black” list, “white” list, “grey” list
- DirtyHash aims to be a recommender
  - Possible applications of recommendation tokens / soulbound tokens
- Insurance idea
  - Risk scores can be used for insurance down-the-line
  - Could get flagged for money laundering
- “We should be using the ideas, but not necessarily the technologies”
- “The point of money is to spend it, not to program it.”
- DirtyHash review
