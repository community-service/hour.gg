<!--end of quick notes-->

- @037: Good or bad? https://cointelegraph.com/news/ethereum-validators-may-have-to-stake-2048-eth-devs-discuss main points are:
  - Discussion: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybgQuRcz9sg 
    - Automated summary: https://www.summarize.tech/www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybgQuRcz9sg
  - Cost to be a validator increases from USD 60k to USD 4m.
  - Staking rewards become autocompounding—this is terrible, stop making this look like an interest payment!!!
  - https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/822 my response
  - There are about 800,000 ETH validators, how many do we need?
  - TRON network has 13 super representatives.
