<!--end of quick notes-->

- What if miners continue to mine!!!??? Let's call it POWNet! Difficulty goes down
- Who benefits from POWNet? Who is likely to be the loudest advocate
  - the biggest miners // because they have a sunk cost in mining equipment which becomes useless in POS
  - NVIDIA EthHash
- What is the economic incentive to validate on a non-mainstream POS network?
  - incentive = stake/{total stake} * value
- USD 1M of marketing sells USD 100M of pictures of animals // so USD 10B of marketing can make POWNet valuable enough that miners use it and NVIDIA's stock goes up 40%
- POWNet will be broken for most bridges
- On POWNet what about the difficulty bomb!?
