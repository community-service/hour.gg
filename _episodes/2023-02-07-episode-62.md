- Implemented our [EIP-6049](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6049) to deprecate `SELFDESTRUCT` in smart contracts

<!--end of quick notes-->

- Accepted and implemented our https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6049 / noted at https://blog.soliditylang.org/2023/02/01/solidity-0.8.18-release-announcement/
  - Longtime consensus to get rid of this, but not officially documented
  - Warnings will now appear when someone tries to use SELFDESTRUCT
  - For CREATE2 will Etherscan mark the old source code as invalid?
    - Lots of great ways to attack this when used for proxy deployments
  - Steal my oldest NFT, the oldest NFT on Ethereum https://fulldecent.blogspot.com/2021/09/there-are-no-nft-contracts-before-terra.html
    - Tell them in the EIP
    - https://etherscan.io/address/0xcde4de4d3baa9f2cb0253de1b86271152fbf7864
- We are working on Soulbind (https://www.soulbind.app/) and want to discuss soulbound tokens, more specifically: 
  - should there be a standard for soulbound tokens
    - Lots of discussion previous on Community Service Hour & [Eth Magicians forum](https://ethereum-magicians.org/search?q=soulbound)
  - restricting soulbound tokens to EOAs
    - tx.origin
    - signed messages
    - any transaction from that person
    - any tx from that person ON ANY CHAIN/NETWORK
    - there is a choice: allowing wallets ⇔ allowing wrapping tokens
  - should soulbound tokens be consensual?
  - updatable tokens – educational course, learn something, get token, learn more, update that token
    - level 1 badge, level 2 update – or a trophy shelf
  - ticketing as a use case for soulbound tokens
