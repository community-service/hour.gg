- Ethereum Cat Herder’s Discord https://discord.io/EthCatHerders
- Workstreams have been created for specific areas, such as wallet devs – should we consider something similar for NFT-related EIPs?}
- How to make the community more reflective of the whole world? Still many circles are dominated by white dudes from rich countries.
  - Some circles are more diverse, like NFT art
  - Since mostly remote-first, could be a good opportunity for moms who want to return to work after focusing on raising kids for a few years
  - Internship opportunities with Ethereum Cat Herders
