- Discussion with @V3CT0RFI – “If you’re building a community, there should be more stringent processes to get onto a marketplace.” Different from people who are selling art with no promise of further activities
- Flippers are valuable, holders are valuable
- Give NFTs away for free, and you’re not liable for a lot of stuff – your income tax, collecting sales tax, etc.
- See: https://hour.gg/episodes/2022-08-16-episode-37.html
  - Board Ape + Business, not just selling empty vision

- Main features:
  - Join new marketplaces with no onboarding fees
  - Transfer tokens without ever having ETH (great for USDD/Latin America)
