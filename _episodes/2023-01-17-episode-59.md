    - Homework answer, what metadata?
      - Coordinates? 2D? 3D? How many dimensions? Point/size?

      - Key questions:
        - Is this Earth or a different orb?
        - Is there exclusive ownership of locations? who mediates?
        - Clusters like Craigslist? Or Minecraft which is territorial?

  Reviewed homework from @exstalis checking out a 2-dimensional (or 3-dimensional) metaverse construct. What is the metadata we would need for tokenizing this?

- Some solutions are: first-dibs/gold-rush for spaces (like DNS/Minecraft) or another way is allowing anybody to use points (like Foursquare/Instagram)

- How do you zoom in when there are too many people in one place? Maybe like Craigslist…

- Reviewed homework from @rito_rhymes checking out different features for QR codes, identified some use cases, still studying how to transfer to ENS names
