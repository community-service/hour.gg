NOTES

- (Elif) community account, perks (free drinks, social events, airdrops), promises (commitment to the community)
- If someone violated something in the community (i.e. promised to teach something, but didn’t do it)
- Tickets (gets right to review, organizer cannot see, only ticketholders can see)
- Attack scenario: community A, community B, community B member gets ticket for community A event?
- A **community** includes **individuals** and **community accounts** (multi-sig), both of who can be **organizer** and create an **event**.
- The **event** is a meetup and is ticketed.
- A community member can make a **promise** ("tag", commitment) to do something. The promise is **upvoted**/**downvoted** by other eligible community members (based on **voting power** from event attendance, score from earned **tags**).
- Question: how to validate who attended the event? give them a **drip**.
- Question: how to use neural programming ("AI") to classify text as positive or negative sentiment?
  - See: https://openai.com/blog/unsupervised-sentiment-neuron/

- Possible solutions for trust
  - Scaffolding – trusted validators
  - Anyone can validate – but it’s public

TWITTER THREAD

- Thank you for joining episode #64!

  First, looking at a common #community-building Web3 problem…

- @elif describes a community application focused around event ticketing and promises to participate in these events… how can validate participation and score/attest to fulfillment of these promises? Can we do it in a #Web3 way?

- Does upvoting/downvoting lead to griefing attacks? And who gets votes?

- Hands-on review using #ChatGPT to do mechanical (but also cognitive) knowledge work.

- Part 2 of the 3-part mini series "Zero Day Live" just dropped https://twitter.com/fulldecent/status/1627497192888889346 #zeroday
