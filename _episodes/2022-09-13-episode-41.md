  - Livia Discord mgr
  - Ben main producer
  - Ellie art director @ellievoxel
  - @dreamsyndicatXR
- How do NFTs that redeem for physical things work?
  - Rawling is a new model https://nft.rawlings.com // drops Sep 14
    - Custodial token – NFT can be redeemed for physical glove
    - Different series and price tiers
    - Redemption requires sending the NFT to a burn address
    - Background from David
      - New project for Rawlings
      - Partly for Rawlings to see how much their audience is interested in NFT
      - Already lots of folks who are physical collectors
      - There will be future projects
    - Rawlings knew nothing about NFTs initially, except one person
    - Went through many rounds of talks with them
    - One VP has been on Discord chats and became interested. Got other folks on board.
    - People know them for gloves. Wanted to do an NFT drop that didn’t feel like a cash grab.
    - Wanted to know what would be the more popular model
    - Launch tomorrow
    - Good mix of people with different interests
  - Comparable model to 
    - Wooshie (sp?) – Plushie with a QR code on it
    - Crypto stamps – From Austrian Post. A flag on the NFT, user keeps both at the same time.
    - .arianee – Certificate of Authenticity model. Watches with paired NFTs
- What is the benefit to people that redeem versus hold the tokens?
- Can they both be rare/collectable?
  - Tokens get rarer as they burn
- Should we give perks to both categories of people?
- Be careful sweepstakes / giveaways / state laws on gambling, skill
- What to do with products that aren't redeemed?
- Bonus Rap performance / vinyl drop @rito_rhymes // directory
- @MetaWrapDrip also jerseys
