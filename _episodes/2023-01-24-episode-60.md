- [NFT nyc](https://nft.nyc/)

<!--end of quick notes-->

- Special guests: Jodee & Cameron organizers of NFT.nyc // what is NFT.nyc's vision for the future?
  - Largest event in NFT space, and probably largest event in crypto!
- History
  - Registered the url in 2018
  - Not even sure if “NFT” was the right name
  - 2019 had more speakers than attendees
  - 2020 started taking off
- Goals
  - 1 Give the community a voice, anyone that is passionate, get them on stage
  - 2 Bring likeminded people together to share ideas
  - 3 Prospertising
  - 4 (new!) Use NFTs to create collaboration and engagement
- Status for NFT.nyc 2023
  - 2000 speaker applications for this year
  - A dozen different tracks
  - 4000 artist submissions
- Where’s the space going?
  - Will: Not gonna get the same sponsors, but thinning out the lame people
    - A lot more famous people
    - Brands that want to sell things
    - If you have three credits on IMDB (any role!) and over 3000 followers on Twitter, you should be selling NFTs
  - Jodee & Cam: In 2023 we’ll likely see
    - Gaming
    - Ticketing
    - Anything to do with fan engagement
- Will we converge to one chain?
  - ETH already kind of won
    - Includes EVM-compatible chains and L2s
    - It’s essentially an internet
  - Solana, Bitcoin are notable, but bridges are hard
  - Using the blockchain networks of today is like similar to dialing in to the internet in the 90s
  - Private networks are fine too
- Bridges
  - Bridges make a lot of sense
  - Anyone holding your stuff is essentially a bridge
  - Bridges are hard – mismatch between size of bounties and size of the pot
  - Needs someone with reputation to come out 
- Applications used at the event
  - Digital twin—
  - Working with Eventbrite
- Coinly tracking your taxes
- How not to go to jail in the NFT space
