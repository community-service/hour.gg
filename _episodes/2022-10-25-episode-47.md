- IDEAS:

  - ThankYou.wtf manifesto
    - What is a thank you?
      - It's public, from somebody, to somebody, and it includes a message, and some points. The points don't matter.
      - Maybe if you send ZERO points it is a message (avoid libel) it's a warning to your friends that you endorsed somebody and you don't like them any more?
      - Is this "gossip"?
      - "Soulbound FUNGIBLE tokens"
    - Why do I want a thank you?
      - Receiving a thank you can make you feel good. Good feelings increase health, longevity and quality of life.
      - Seeing thank yous from people you care about to new people can inform you if you want to be around those new people.
    - How do you send it?
      - You publish to ThankYou.wtf and blockchain using a signed message.
      - Or if you don't publish it then it sits on the ThankYou.wtf for 2 weeks. Maybe the recipient or somebody else will publish it. If nobody publishes it, the TYwtf website deletes it. If you somehow publish it directly onto a blockchain, the TYwtf website will pick it up.
    - How do you receive it? ???? DO WE WANT THIS PART? JUST HAVE THEM SEND A THANK YOU BACK?
      - You don't have to receive it.
    - Who are you sending it to?
      - Can send to a website (see Chrome list of common website domains), a specific page (twitter profile?), or a blockchain address.
    - How does the message work?
      - You type whatever you want. Up to 280 characters.
    - How do the points work?
      - You can send as many points as you want. You can make your points be any color or design. (ERC-1155.) Anybody can send themself points, they don't matter.
      - All the points (and messages) you send out to each person will show up on your page. If people care about your points the ThankYou.wtf website will also show them on the recipient's page.
      - You can send at most X points to a person at a time.
    - How is this built
      - Thank yous are signed messages like
        THANKYOU/RECIPIENT_ADDRESS_OR_HASH/POINTS/MESSAGE
      - how to do timestamps? how to revoke yourself?
      - Which blockchain do they settle on? can people repost them on other chains?
    - How can I connect my product to ThankYou.wtf?
      - You can send thank yous on chain or send to us. (Spam prevention?)
      - You can read the points, these are SBTs. And you can use them to authenticate into a website.
      - Points only go up as time goes on. But you can also calculate POWER which is some function of points and recency. You can use this power to control access to your community or help you make decisions (do we want to say voting?
    - Is there censorship / distributed?
      - You are free to use ThankYou.wtf however you like. We can censor the Thank Yous that you send to us if necessary or if it makes our product better. But we cannot censor anything you send directly to the blockchain or which you distribute in other ways.
    - What does it cost?
      - This product is free to use on ThankYou.wtf and on blockchains near you.
      - Our operating expenses are X and we received X donations. You can send thank yous to this project at Y.
      - If you would like to host your own copy of this project or maybe don't like our branding, call us. We work as consultants, call us, prices start at USD 10,000.
    - Other features
      - Email login to get notified of thank yous.
      - Browser extension to thank you any website (see Brave extension and how it find the author of any page)
    - More notes
      - Is this more like LinkedIn where have a million connections and don't even know these people, like Twitter where I might know them or just want to read them, or like my phone contacts list where these are really people I know?
      - Snap chat has streaks each day
      - Tying accounts to 

- Community Service Hour Army
