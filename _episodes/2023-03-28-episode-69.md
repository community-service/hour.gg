<!--end of quick notes-->

- Try a few tbones
  - JSON to YAML
  - Use the secret code to make better apps “@@ROLE@@” @@ASSISTANT@@ and @@USER@@
  - Text up to the first secret code is a “system” message
- SEC CFTC and DOJ are playing Risk, dividing the map on who each will attack

  - disclosure, I had done work with a related firm, TRON DAO
  - Related: https://twitter.com/fulldecent/status/1638652795329847300 
  - You need to know: if somebody is paying you to promote a token (which might be a security?) you need to disclose that paid relationship and the amount you were paid (if in the US) see SEC rules
  - Problems are almost always related to marketing, not the actual product
- TRON play testing video / https://youtu.be/8mMCT7rQBe0 
- Celebrity endorsements
  - Lindsey Lohan and others got in troubz
- Eventually some consensus will arise among the agencies

  @soliditylang

- We tried a few testt bones.

  Here is one that we made to convert JSON to YAML and we look at how the code works

  https://tbone.ai/app?id=3 /// MAKE GUEST PASS

- Discussed SEC allegations against TRON / TRON DAO / Justin Sun and more.

  Alleged wash sales, fake liquidity, and unregistered security.

- Settlements/allegations: with Logan Paul, Lindsay Lohan and more, for promoting crypto tokens without disclosing payment the received, and TRON telling them not to disclose

- You need to know: If somebody is paying you to promote a token (which might be a security?), you need to disclose that paid relationship and the amount you were paid (if in the US). See SEC rules [link?]

- How do we get clarity about whether CFTC/SEC rules apply? We're waiting!
