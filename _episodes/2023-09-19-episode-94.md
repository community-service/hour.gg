<!--end of quick notes-->

1. Blog post: review 9 dapp login systems https://twitter.com/fulldecent/status/1702160272180277548
   1. Web2: passwords (should be hashed)
      1. 1:1 relationship – no one else knows you logged in
   2. Dapps: backed by public cryptography
      1. Everyone can know – publicly published and signed
      2. (most dapps are not really distributed)
      3. Issues
         1. What was actually signed?
         2. Do you know what you’re signing?
      4. Proper logins: attestation, entropy, time limitation, signed by customer’s private key
   3. Found several vulnerabilities across big NFT sites
   4. Ulti question: Many blockchain games adding web2 logins, does that affect this?
      1. Nope – still vulnerable
2. Sec Stoner Cats https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-178 
   1. Great educational case
   2. SEC claims:
      1. Marketed knowledge of crypto projects
      2. Touted price would go up
      3. Took other steps to make investors believe they would profit
   3. “Lighting up the cave”
   4. How did they choose this project?
      1. Complaints likely received
      2. Size of the project
      3. Probably considered people who they can actually “get” in the US
   5. Why did they wait so long?
3. IRS definition of NFT https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-23-27.pdf 
   1. US Congretional Research Office https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R47189 
   2. SEC commissioners going against https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce-uyeda-statement-nft-082823#_ftn1
