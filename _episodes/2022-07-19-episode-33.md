<!--end of quick notes-->

- @SizzleJia experience // how do scams work // who is legally responsible? // what to do?
  - @OnChain Monkey new collection called Karma
  - Minted the new collection, but NFT requires 12 hours to reveal which one it is
  - Got as invitation in official Discord to "mint a special drop", appeared to be a founder
    - Linked to minting webpage
      - MetaMask had a warning "this is a dangerous action", she rejected it
  - Disconnected setApprovalForAll
  - Reported to OpenSea and flagged, cannot be listed for sale
  - Compare to other sales platforms // buying stocks in a regulated marketplace // buying stolen merchandise
    - Is OpenSea like a broker/dealer? Custody is different. Known counterparty is different.
    - **Did OpenSea flag other assets that the thief from SizzleJia's OnChain Monkey? Or are they waiting for people to complain and handling them one-by-one?**
  - Ideas to solve
    - Prevention
      - Gnosis-like time lock
      - Alternatives to “Admins will never DM first”?
    - Recovery
      - Regular legal routes to recover stolen goods
  - Don't feel helpless when you are taken advantage of (while using Web3) there are rules and laws to protect you
  - Are there ways the Discord mods could have prevented outreach like that?
    - Probably OnChain Monkeys could not have done a better job
    - Discord could turn off DMs by DEFAULT // TWITTER POLL
    - Discord could track reputations of links, and have a official links list, warn for others
    - Discord could better explain which role are "official" and speak for the community
- Why might Discord need to be more vigilant than Twitter? It’s easier to look official on Discord, because they are small communities.
