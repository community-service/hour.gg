subtitle: Good enough for your business?
description: Highlighting its utility as a tool to claim digital badges or "Bookmarks for life". While the mobile app showcased a count of collected POAPs and allowed users to log in via email instead of a wallet address, challenges surfaced around onboarding, especially for those without a pre-existing digital wallet. Onboarding is managed by Privy.io. Questions arose about the product's revenue model, its smart contract, and the roles within the project. The episode also touched on POAP's pronunciation and acknowledged technical audio issues.
