<!--end of quick notes-->

- Philly-based podcast obligatory mention of how the Eagles are going to (win) the Super Bowl this year
  - Cars will be flipped
  - Poles will be ungreased
  - Get ready
- Show and tell: dynamic QR codes https://github.com/fulldecent/jump-qrs (@Rito_Rhymes)
  - This repository shows how to create and use dynamic QR codes. This a code that you can scan, but which will land on a different page based on the configuration in this repository at the time of scan.
  - In other words, if you change your website or have a different mood today, you don't need to go reprint all your QR codes.
  - Why implement this way?
    - Very easy. You don’t even need to know HTML.
      - Make PR to readme: why this best practice is being followed in this implementation choice (to hide details like "adding a space to your email subject requires a %20 in your URL")
    - DRRY principle – Do Not Repeat Yourself
      - Make PR to readme: why this best practice is being followed in this implementation choice (to avoid updating all files when branding changes)
    - Let’s go Rito!
- DAO Planning
  - We have some URLs: thankyou.wtf, hour.gg
  - Cross-chain
    - Not financial, just giving “props”
    - How does it work?
      - Thank-yours are for a specific person
      - Create a message off-chain, sign it, and anyone can play that message on any other chain
      - Would cost gas to post the message on a different network
      - Identity of the people involved has to be valuable to the viewer
      - Verifiable that one identity has thanked another
      - Ideation about taking it back: 
        - Unthank-you / revocation
        - Devalidation if you got hacked
        - Similar to OCSPA
- Non-consensual tokens community recovery? (Elif @exstalis)
  - You are in a community, did something wrong, and want to get a scarlet letter
  - How to override damage to reputation–time can be a criteria/factor
  - Prepare a picture for her project—community issues a borderless experience
