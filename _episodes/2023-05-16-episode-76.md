title: What is money?
subtitle: "Intro to the write your first smart contract workshop"
description: In this episode, we explored key concepts such as what is a token, what is an NFT, what is money and how a coat check works. These elements will help understand the design behind blockchain systems. We differentiated between ERC-20/bitcoin and ERC-721/NFT, and how they relate to conventional money and coat check systems. Get ready for the next week''s workshop!

TWEET

- First time ever! The "write your first smart contract workshop" open to the public, live on Twitter and Twitch!

- NON TECHNICAL, and all about the common sense.

- First question: what is money!

  [[ PHOTO OF THE MONEY]] // this is a money shot

  Here it is as a blog post too [https://blog.phor.net/what-is-money](https://blog.phor.net/what-is-money) Shout out to @missvikii for being VERY knowledgeable about money

- Next question: how does a coat check work?

  People store valuable coats there.

  And WHY don't they get stolen more often?

- These two points are MAJOR considerations in designing blockchain systems and you need to understand them completely.

- Then we get into blockchainâ€”what is ERC-20/Bitcoin, what is ERC-721/NFT. And how are they fundamentally different from the money and coat checks we are used to?

- Now you are prepared! Next week is the 2/2 workshop to make your own smart contact.

- Thank you for staying to the VERY END of the show. Shout out to:
