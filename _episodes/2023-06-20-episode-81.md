<!--end of quick notes-->

- Axelle Moortgat: [OnChainBunnies](http://onchainbunnies.io) research
  - Optimizations
    - Generation instead of storage (Loot generation, SVG)
    - Optimizer
      - Solidity gets translated to opcode by EVM
      - SSTORE is the most expensive opcode
    - Memory data
      - Storage options: Storage data, call data, and memory data
      - Every time you ask for memory data, code is read, data is declared, and data is deleted
    - Bitfieldencoding
      - How to store the IDs?
      - Use bits for every trait
      - Bitfield operations are very cheap
      - Store one integer and get all the data once
  - Random ID generation
    - Uncovered insider trading
      - Developer knows which IDs have which traits and will tell friends
    - How to prevent this? Need to reveal IDs randomly
    - Need a random number, but this is hard on blockchain
    - Some ways
      - Timestamp
      - Miner address
      - Who will be next validator
      - Combination of these to generate a random number
    - Still need to figure out how to generate the IDs as a result
      - Pick numbers in an ascending order
      - Random ID picking algorithm
      - ID revealed at mint
      - Tradeoffs: Can abort transactions if you don’t like what you minted
    - "Randomness can be controlled by sandwiches"

1. Community Service Hour episode 81 featuring @axellemoortgat @OnChainBunnies @ryestew

   Key points for efficiently putting image-NFTs on chain

   And things you might not know about Remix IDE

2. Best practices for generating the images when needed ON-CHAIN, and minimizing storage (SSTORE) use.

3. "Randomness can be controlled by sandwiches" // @legend has the official framed book note for this!

4. See also our article https://blog.phor.net/randomization-strategies-nft-drops about all the tradeoffs

5. Check out Remix at https://remix.ethereum.org and now I can see all this documentation that was always there. Here is where to find it…
