The Microsoft / Facebook VC valuation trick

- Farcaster is "\$150M / 15% = \$1B"

- > "Facebook and Microsoft Corp. today announced that the two companies would expand their advertising partnership and that Microsoft will take a $240 million equity stake in Facebookâ€™s next round of financing at a $15 billion valuation"
  >
  > https://news.microsoft.com/2007/10/24/facebook-and-microsoft-expand-strategic-alliance/

- $240m = 1.6% * X VAL + Advertising

- 10,000s users $1b?
