- Invite to the episode: Makis, Sander, Raido, Estonia crypto chamber (co-sponsor?), BitBoy
- Photo: many fingers on a button
- Workshop: How to implement the European kill switch (required for smart contracts) // part 1 of 3, who can press the button
  - Draft status
  - Focused on internet of things
  - GDPR defined who is the owner of data and who is the processor of data
  - This is kind of a next step in GDPR
  - Requirement:
    - safe termination and interruption: ensure that a mechanism exists to terminate the continued execution of transactions: the smart contract shall include internal functions which can reset or instruct the contract to stop or interrupt the operation to avoid future (accidental) executions; 
    - 
  - If you get published in the [Official Journal of the European Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_Journal_of_the_European_Union), the requirements are “presumed” to be followed
  - According to the definition of a “smart contract”, a calculator (or any program on a computer) counts.
  - Is the blockchain itself a "smart contract"? and that makes them all illegal?
  - Recommendation: recursive Gnosis safes

1. Episode 78 reviews the Data Act and the European kill switch that will be required for smart contracts.

2. It looks like even the calculator app is a smart contract depending on how you read the regulation.

   Bitcoin and Ethereum mining also appear to be illegal unless they have backdoors.
