- Can NFT royalty payments be ENFORCED on-chain?
  - Yes, ERC-721 can require payment (of Ether) to transfer (the buyer or seller!) an NFT. But ERC-1155 cannot require this in the safe(Batch)?TransferFrom function.
  - **Question:** how many OpenSea transactions are already using side channel buyer-seller collusion to avoid fees?
    - Key point: the smart contract does NOT know the full sale price (just like government does not know full sale price of your car @snapboogie)
    - Enforce:
      - Seller consigns the asset to auctioneer with no minimum bid
      - If the bid increment is larger than the collusion saving (i.e. royalty/tax/marketplace cost)
    - Enforce on-chain:
      - Only reliable if the fee is a fixed-price fee
      - Using pricing set by some kind of bonding curve or more generic function
        - Time-based (velocity)
        - Total amt of ETH
    - Enforce off-chain:
      - Use an appraiser (oracle, tax investigator)
  - Other encumberances in assets sales (transactions with other silent parties involved)
    - Land grant → sales restrictions to certain parties ("no [certain racial group]") or use restrictions ("no houses" -> local watershed)
    - Each new party agrees to the full terms of sale
  - Should NFT be "sales" or should should be "licenses", licenses have different kinds of terms and there is a different expectation of agreement/law/redistribution/terms from recipients/licensees/"buyers?"
    - ERC-721 uses the word "owner" all over it / ergo there is a reasonable expectation that this is "sale" and a license
    - Is there scope to create ERC-721 specification clone for licenses (that are transferable?) or an extension that is specifically for licensing (soulbound?)
- Ways around just about anything
  - Wrapper contracts
- Moral stance
