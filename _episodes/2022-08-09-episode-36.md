<!--end of quick notes-->

- The Solidity bug
- Contract review: Arbitrum/Bridgeworld Harvesters
- Minified the bug case significantly from the [Ethereum Foundation’s announcement](https://blog.soliditylang.org/2022/08/08/calldata-tuple-reencoding-head-overflow-bug/)
- Searched for functions in [OpenSea’s Seaport repo](https://github.com/ProjectOpenSea/seaport) that are subject to the bug
  - ABI code
    - Find all abi.encode…
    - Find all external calls
  - Dynamic
    - Find strings
    - Find bytes
    - Find []
  - Static
    - \[d+\]
- Also search contracts for Zora, Binance NFT Marketplace, Foundation
- Got very close, but didn’t find any!
