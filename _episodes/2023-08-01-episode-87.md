title: PA sales tax
subtitle: "And the sock loophole"
description: Discusses PA's sales tax on NFTs, with a spotlight on how they are defined and taxed. Surprisingly, regulations date back to 2016, but there was no retroactive enforcement before May 2022. The hosts highlight a loophole where NFTs linked to non-taxable items, like clothing, could avoid tax. They also delve into Su Squares, NFTs that allow pixel edits since 2018. Major queries raised include defining transfers and creations in the NFT world. The episode critiques PA's documentation style and juxtaposes regulations with real-world NFT products, underscoring potential inconsistencies.

- Definition: “A non-fungible token, or NFT, is a unique set of software codes recorded on a blockchain, which is used to certify authenticity and ownership of a digital representation of something of value that can be bought, sold, and traded.”
- The socks loophole "If the NFT is not a digital good as defined in 72 P.S. § 7201(m)(2) or is intended to grant ownership or use of a nontaxable product or service (for example clothing), the sale at retail of the transfer of ownership or a right to use an NFT is not taxable.

- Su Squares
  - Square NFTs since 2018
  - Paid income tax when sold
  - Most sold before May 2022
  - If you have the token, you can edit pixels on a page
  - All 10k Su Squares were minted in the first block
  - Minted the NFTs to itself (its smart contract)
  - The contract will sell the NFTs to the buyer
  - Lots of open questions:
    - Is a creation a transfer? 
    - Or is creation only when a human makes something new?
    - Are sales of Su Squares subsequent sales?
