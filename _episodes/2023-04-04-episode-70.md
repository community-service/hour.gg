NOTES

- Erguotou Soda (probably terrible, but Will is a fan)
- [Sam Altman’s support for Worldcoin](https://u.today/sam-altmans-worldcoin-unveils-tech-to-prove-you-are-human)

  - Is proof of personhood really critical?
  - Claims of privacy about iris-scanning is hard to swallow
    - How devices with private key inside get hacked
  - Feels like an overt plan to take over the world
    - Would be more credible to collaborate with governments instead of going over the top
    - [Pinky & The Brain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinky_and_the_Brain#The_Brain)
  - Main types of voting
    - Role-based
    - Token-based
  - Review the Worldcoin mythbusting article
- P256 on EVM: https://p256.alembic.tech/
  - Private-public key paradigm is used all over
  - Wauthn is a W3C recommendation
  - Can replace passwords
    - (Solution to passwords is the account issuer also issues the password instead of user choosing)
  - Soft wallet
  - Webauthn message is not signed on-chain, so we need to figure out who pays
  - EIP-4337 might address this, but the whole premise is dependent on that EIP
  - Basically a bridge from EVM networks to webauthn
- Self healing code // the "seesaw technique"
- 6:40 – Open discussion
  - @janacmeena7: Any thoughts on the new erc-4337 @web3news_media

- Episode 70!

  With hot takes on @worldcoin, interesting ideas, viable growth strategy, but no I don't want iris scanning, and no I don't think governments want a pan-national entity doing their UBI

- Who pays for the UBI?

- P256 on EVM @w3c recommendation for Webauthn, thank you @codekaiju and more 

  This is a plan for "bridging" EVM with Webauthn, currently in alpha status, issues remain: can that be a transaction (EIP-4337), or who has to pay the gas?

- Thank you for staying to the end!
