- [Mercedes supports NFTs in dash](https://nxt.mercedes-benz.com/faqs)
- [Qumosi](https://qumosi.com/)
- [Namefi](https://www.namefi.io/)

<!--end of quick notes-->

- I studied the web pages for [Call Her Daddy](https://www.callherdaddy.com/) and [Rogan Experience](https://www.joerogan.com/), then updated [ours](https://hour.gg/) to be [clearer, have better value proposition](https://github.com/community-service/hour.gg/commit/c09b8b5faa81d11888736b769e59daaa36dfc9aa)
- NFTs are officially dead https://twitter.com/fulldecent/status/1745321076437991918 // next topic
- can we make a quick tool to make hex profile photos in a circle (in a square) see // https://twitter.com/natealexnft

  - The experience vs. X
  - A place to upload your projects
  - Everything—assets, models, code
  - Smart contracts angle—payment gateway, want to avoid PayPal, censorship resistant, for donations // ?? why single channel
  - Mantra: anti-censorship, anti-single-point-of-failure, immutable // https://www.namefi.io/
  - Problems: spam—invite key is not long term, self governing velocity limit, negative decay model, fees go to stake pool which generates from burn fee
- [Namefi](https://www.namefi.io/) / DNS owned by NFTs to secure them and make easier to transfer
  - What is the exit plan if Namefi fails? Domains are very long term.
  - ICANN has a designee process to handle failed registrars / ("delegate" process)
  - If there's Angel investors / so there's profit investors ("squatting" on new ideas)
  - Prices are they one-year price updates or multi-year
