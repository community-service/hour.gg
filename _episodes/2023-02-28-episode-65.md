- [Blur's loyalty program](https://twitter.com/blur_io/status/1628158976662851584), is it legal?

<!--end of quick notes-->

- Blur overtakes OpenSea in NFT trade volume
  - ![img](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/iGy7z4rSbIBre-CWbWp1zZ5U3qWPpMwk6XZUZOEgaHqwLNTpDJo7EqQTFamNPRCK_FtG_JFSSrM8SW2N8DjHz2p6xl9PfwTvzI4l8eUtjnL1QqNzYIydYkvOrZ39JdmI04F-TPiuPmWPEhrUBTcYx2A)
  - Lots of volume from their airdrops and probably wash trading
- Why isn’t there innovation in browsers and wallets?
  - At least Microsoft Edge is trying with their right sidebar
  - People need to pay for this stuff
  - First-party search being mediated by third-parties
  - Why not custom search algorithms per person / per browser that people can choose
  - Google’s custom search JSON API – you can create your own results
- What happens to all these well-funded hackathon/shill/learn-2-earn communities? The prizes are smaller now and dev interest seems to be waning.
  - Devs/startups still have money
  - “Not every student needs 50k to show up somewhere”
  - Instead
    - Spend the money on parties instead
  - Pay for teachers to show up instead
  - 3-month hackathon, bring ppl out for a party later
  - What is there between a 24-hour hackathon and locking arms with a company?
- What should we ask Ben in a few weeks?
  - why better than ENS
  - is Twitter the right future?
  - do people want to be tracked?
  - What’s the moat for Kazm?
- Episode 3 of zero-day hacking mini series drop https://youtu.be/JXzbOVIHNc0

- @Blur_io overtakes @opensea
  due to lower prices, airdropping tokens, cutting royalty fees and…

[[CHART]]

- Anticompetitive "loyalty" tracking. Is that legal?

- Why isn’t there innovation in browsers and wallets?

  The wallet has first access to every intention and action you are doing. They could intermediate themselves in a lot more places.

- Next meeting with Ben from @kazmapp get your questions ready!
