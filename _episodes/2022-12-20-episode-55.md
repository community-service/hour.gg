<!--end of quick notes-->

- [Twitter question](https://twitter.com/dustdust213/status/1585041760954200064) from @dustdust213: Isn’t twitter developing a wallet for crypto and we already have tipping available here on twitter so the question is why do we need a thank you system if people can just tip or post a comment on someone’s tweet?
