- Q: What is moon dust?

  A: Some people went to the moon. Not everybody is going. And we saw some great ideas there. We are bringing those ideas back to Earth to make existing businesses better.

- Blog post [https://blog.phor.net/token-curated-registries-uses-exploits
  
  ](https://blog.phor.net/token-curated-registries-uses-exploits)Shout outs to @ConsenSys Mike Goldin, and @augurproject

  Token-curated registries are the precursor to "distributed autonomous organizations".

- New paper https://blog.phor.net/moon-dust-auditable-versioned-databases 

  This is the longer paper and talk on auditable versioned databases… first discussed at DeSciNYC… now developed into the full paper, GitHub repo example and now this episode.

  Greetz to @DeSciNYC community!
