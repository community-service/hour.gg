  For securing files, a comparison between Web3 and traditional cloud storage like iCloud could be insightful, including operational security considerations. Regarding Terminal DAO's new deck, it appears that the challenge is to create a community that operates on trust without committing real money, using tokens for value management and designing an appropriate protocol for financial sustainability. Penney Army is a meme project that encourages creativity over template usage, showcasing the collaborative spirit within the community.

- Web3 storage vs. iCloud // some opsec on file storage
- Terminal DAO / new deck coming out
  - Impetus: WHY CAN"T WE JUST USE MONEY?
    - A possible answer: we want to have a community that makes consensus decisions and we want to penalize people for breach of trust but those people are anonymous AND none of these people want to commit real money
  - Implementation:
    - Value—manage this with a token supply (up?, down?)
    - Protocol—do you need sustainable funding (even temporary?)
    - Payments—peg (?), redeemable (?), offer to sell (?)
