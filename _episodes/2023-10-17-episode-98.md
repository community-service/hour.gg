<!--end of quick notes-->

- Type juggling optimization (storage bit stuffing)
  - The "signature trick" 32B + 32B + 1B → 64B for public key signatuares
  - The bit-stuffing: 48bits for your timestamp + … …. = 256bts, just make sure that you put them in the correct order in your Solidity contract definition
  - Should we have an extension for this? Or at least a checklist for optimizing.
  - Keep in mind 
    - Slots
    - Loops
    - Reentrancy
  - Linters
    - 037 tried a linter that flagged lots of false positive reentrancies

    - Watch out for sandwiching/frontrunning
    - buy(tokenId, price) // for a ERC-20 order
    - buy(tokenId) payable // for a ETH order
- Pentesting as a service

  - If you don't define what is your front hole and back hole, then all your holes are back holes
