1. Episode 71, talking about OpenSea, if it has a backdoor it is a centralized system… they can be sanction, confiscated, and seized by governments imposing on OpenSea (a US company)
2. Seal healing code, watched several iterations of a full Python program started by a prompt: help me find recent closing prices for $TSLA stock
