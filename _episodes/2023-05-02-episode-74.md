title: Tokenomics
subtitle: "The root of all money"
description: In this episode, we dive deep into the exploration of tokenomics. We learn about the importance of intuitive understanding and creative mindset while dealing with tokenomics. We also address questions from the audience and share insights into intriguing topics such as digital spaces, smart contract languages, NFTs and how to construct future digital spaces.

<!--end of quick notes-->

- @tasrikan How do I prove tokenomics just like how I do in Mathematics or Physics or Computers?
  - The whole purpose of is to sell an IDEA to somebody // the idea has to make sense
  - Sometimes there is nothing valuable here AT ALL, so the idea can't be too simple
  - We use analogies (for your target audience)
  - We are working with FLOWs of tokens
  - Electrical circuits // sources and sinks
  - Monte Carlo simulation
  - Don't prove anything, just show the sources and the sinks, give them stupid names, rely on intuition and creativity

- Question by @exstalis: How we can improve/flex nft metdata to address the following research topics mentioned in
  - *A Unified Ecological Framework for Studying Effects of Digital Places on Well-being*
    - *his active identity construction carries over to geosocial data as well, through* *the selection of which places warrant posting and/or checking in on geographically referenced* *social media networks. Schwartz and Halegoua (2015)*
    - *describe this selection through the* *framework of the spatial self, which examines the presentation of one’s identity through* *geographic traces of physical (i.e., real world) activity. As described by Saker (2017) the spatial* *self ‘involves people actively thinking about the spaces they frequent, what they might present* *about their identity, and if this fits in with their on-going narratives.’ –* *A Unified Ecological Framework for Studying Effects of Digital Places on Well-being (Note: Can we use NFTs as a representation of a physical place regardless of the inside or outside experience of the architeture that shapes our identity ? (culturally, pyschologically and social for example) )*
    - *"We conclude by discussing the strengths and limitations of applying the framework to studies of place and well-being."*
    - *The concept of place in geography has been simply described as physical environments (spaces) with meaning and utility (Moon, 1990), which reflects how humans subjectively (e.g., my home, my place of work) and objectively (e.g., the City of Toronto) give rise to places. Digital platforms have also been described as places where meaning arises through interactions with digital platforms and surrounding physical environments (i.e., a fusion of experiences in digital and physical places) (Horan, 2001).* 
    - *Hot take— this paper had too old citations to consider the impact of digital spaces & well being (e.g. paper is pre-pandemic, and its citations are 10+ years old)*
  - Studying well being, communication, civilization, empathy, "outsideness", expressing life experiences // use as a grounding baseline for how to construct future digital spaces

- How does a testnet like Goerli work, under the hood? 
- a) ⅓ nft generate with deploy , after that users can mint nfts in the contract at a fixed price, for example 0.01eth. Is it necessary for this to create two separate mint for us and make a public mint ? Will this greatly affect the cost of gas? or can this be solved by other functions?
  b) We use one function and we make 10k nfts at once and they will immediately get to the marketplace. What is the optimal function to use in this case for small gas?
  c) Is there a function for automatically adding a money from the nft smart contract to the liquidity pool? 
  d) is there an automatic offering for sale function (for opensea) or only external scripts? 
  e) do we have function to automatic range pricing of the nft depending on the rarity immediately in the code of the smart contract ? Thank you!!!
