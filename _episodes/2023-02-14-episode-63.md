2. We looked at large language model jailbreaks // Bing Chat (OpenAI, like ChatGPT) is really Sydney, see its context/how it was programmed

3. After years of editing, now releasing Zero Day Live, a three part mini series about ethical hacking.

   We demonstrate a #zeroday with #fulldisclosure, live and go through the ethics and technology… racing against the clock to inform affected people!
