description: In this episode, we discuss NFT event ticketing, the current state of Yuga Labs, and explore the concept of blockchain-inspired database design. We delve into the potential of NFT ticketing applications, reviewing aspects such as royalty splitting, MSRP, refund policies, and limited transfers. Guest speaker, @temmanuel sheds light on the use of @ensdomains ''fuses'' and token gating, and touches upon the use of @jsonschema to standardize NFT metadata. We also touch upon auditable databases with @darianbailey14. Stay till the end for some insightful discussions.

  - No // wat is this lol
- @temmanuel / Ticketing Standard (721t - Upgradable )
  - NFT functions (e.g. ERC-721)
    - Transfer
      - Deny if **max_transfers** exceeded (per token?)
      - Deny transfers after the event happens / other time based
    - Mint
    - Redeem
  - Royalty (e.g. ERC-2981)
    - Royalty %
    - Splitting
      - Could be handled with ERC-2981 using a custodian
      - Could use a competitor to ERC-2981
  - Control sale price 
    - Controlling sale price (not to be sold for more than [%] than X (X potentially being face value)
    - There are laws/regulations around ticket pricing (not necessarily need to do in smart contract)
    - Enforceability could be encouraged by partnering/blocking marketplaces
    - Make a standard to express this restriction / **which entities will be in the ecosystem?**
      - **An ERC to express allowable sale prices**
  - Refund
    - Will it be burned? Or can it be reissued/voided?
  - One-time features
    - Redeemable Component [X] / fuses? handle in metadata? food / meet and greet?
    - This is an important product decision (tear off edge of ticket or secondary tickets)
  - Metadata on-chain
    - Event information / Event Title, Description / participation restrictions (age? rated R?) / Venue Name / Venue Location / Event URL
    - Ticket information / Asset Title / Section / Row / Seat
    - Redemptions & mutable information / Redeemed Timestamp / Redeemed Wallet address
  - Systems integration
    - Graphic (can change/revealed when redeemed) / Asset Media (initial state) / -Asset Media (redeemed state) / -Asset Media (surprised State) / -Asset Media (voided State)
    - Can be done as a change on-chain (IPFS) or could be on Web2 metadata server
  - Associated Media Name [X] (Token-gated)
  - Rules
  - Try publishing your own JSON schema for your metadata format? and add semantic meaning / schema for it 
- Sqlite audit example (darianb.eth)
  - Current usecases? Major roadblocks to adoption?
  - Attestation how? Signature through web portal after kyc?
  - Inclusion proofs? Hash the db and check inclusion? Seems like any db could do this?
  - planned next steps? postgres extension?

1. Discussing NFT event ticketing, the death(?) of Yuga Labs and blockchain-inspired database design for business (web2.5?) on Community Service Hour #72

   https://youtu.be/BAIDZjLpwfE

2. Reviewing NFT ticketing applications with @temmanuel

   Royalty split
   MSRP
   Refunds
   Limited # of transfers
   Redemptions (@ensdomains "fuses")
   Token gating

   Can also use their own @jsonschema to standardize NFT metadata

3. Is @yugalabs dead?

   No. Going strong. Some days one of your million community efforts flops. Or even the hardware hosting the event flops.

4. Auditable databases with @darianbailey14

   Current use cases, roadblocks to adoption?
   Quick demo with SQLite
   Comparing inclusion proofs with blockchain
   SOX compliance

5.
