<!--end of quick notes-->

- Used to be one-hack-a-week rhythm, but slowed down
- Now we’re back with Nomad
  - https://twitter.com/fulldecent/status/1554597775412805633 The contract address
  - Addressed with a16z crypto security team ([former leaders of Facebook’s Novi wallet](https://a16z.com/2021/10/11/nassim-and-riyaz/))
- https://twitter.com/nomadxyz_/status/1554246853348036608
  - Transaction malleability (replayable)
    - Malleability (maybe TX is signed but then can be changed BUT the original or changed version can only be used once so there is one "nullifier")
      - Read the GM17 paper to see more on this
    - Cryptographic non-injuction

  - Almost impossible to find the smart contracts on etherscan
  - Why doesn’t the Nomad website:
    - Mention that the contracts are upgradeable
    - Share the actual addresses of their live contracts
  - It does (quietly in the docs): https://docs.nomad.xyz/operational-security/contracts
  - Nomad docs about [governance](https://github.com/nomad-xyz/docs/blob/main/docs/index.md)
- Nomad’s [contracts on Github](https://github.com/nomad-xyz/monorepo/tree/main/packages/contracts-bridge/contracts)
