- [OpenSea will demonitize if you list on other marketplaces](https://support.opensea.io/hc/en-us/articles/1500009575482)

<!--end of quick notes-->

- OpenSea requires all new NFT projects to enforce on-chain creator fees, or get demonetized
  - Is this anticompetitive in an illegal or disallowed way?
  - Why didn’t OpenSea just let people opt-out of royalties?
  - Feels like the artist is being held for ransom rather than actually being helped
  - Background
    - https://support.opensea.io/hc/en-us/articles/1500009575482

    - How contracts can specify owners and royalties on-chain
      - EIP-173 ownerOf is the way to identify artists today
      - EIP-2981 NFT Royalty Standard
  - Implementation example
    - https://github.com/LightArtists/light-smart-contracts/blob/v2-metadata-editable/contracts/Light.sol
    - onlyAllowedOperatorApproval modifier
  - Is this still better for artists than what was before OpenSea/NFT marketplaces?
  - Spent all this time writing documentation and tweeting about it, but didn’t even implement it in their own store yet
- An extension for token contracts: make setApprovalForAll cheaper
  - Use messages, Gas-free setApprovalForAll
  - Extension of 20/721/1155
  - Doesn’t change how royalties work, if users want to apply royalties
  - Breakdown explanation
    - Have to Approve when listing on OpenSea
    - Signed message doesn’t need to settle on-chain until you actually transfer the token
  - Anyone who works at Blur, X2/Y2, Rarible, Looksrare to try this out?
  - See EIP-1153 royalty router
