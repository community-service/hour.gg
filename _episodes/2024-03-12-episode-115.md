  - "Hanging with @VictorWeiChen and @FeliciaDePIN to talk about @fogworksinc's #DePIN product Foggie Max [IMAGE]"
  - "And then @pwstaples shows up and asks all the right questions:\n\n- What is DePIN?\n\n- Can installing mining on my computer fry my computer?\n- Does running a node make me liable for bad stuff that people put on it?\n\nPerfect questions, answers in the video \U0001F447\U0001F447"
  - "And @7DACreator, the optimist and inquisitor checks in about @DIMO_Network\n\n- How does it get on your tractor?\n- What's the long-term plan?\n- How can we grow the project?"
  - "Last, a note about @superstatefunds by @rleshner.\n\nIt is tokenizing short-dated US bills now.\n\nBut is this a submarine project to tokenize the complicated US equities market and change settlement to T+0?"
  - "For all this, and @Legend's Bitcoin price prediction for tomorrow, type in COMMUNITY SERVICE HOUR into your podcast app.\n\nOr smash this video link:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/JKGM-Ch66iI"
