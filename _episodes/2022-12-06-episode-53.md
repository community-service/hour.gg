- [NFT Tallinn](https://nfttallinn.com), Estonia May 9, 2023

<!--end of quick notes-->

- Sander @ [WOF Labs](https://worldoffreight.xyz)
  - Started in 2021, with the mission to create a blockchain for supply chains
  - World of Freight NFTs
    - Built a mini-game
    - Aiming to make it a supply chain simulator – racing game
    - First infrastructure for other games – NFT renting
      - Let ppl put up for rent for # of games or certain time
      - Renter puts up payment or share a % of winnings
      - Using Chainlink’s keepers
      - Font-end – original owners see their ‘Fleets’ and choose which to rent
        - Internal marketplace
      - Not moving assets
      - Previously: Either direct p2p renting or a 3rd party guarantees giving back (but this only makes sense for high value assets with enough collateral)
      - Newer: Proxy wallets, allowing just view permissions to share but not write permissions
      - Can put the assets in escrow, but this wastes gas
      - Game runs on polygon, but assets are on Ethereum
      - You can even sell during the rental and rental contracts just get voided and pre-payment returned
      - All transaction info is on-chain
      - Considering using Unlock protocol
    - Currently in documentation and testing phase
    - 
  - Entrepreneur for many years
- [NFT Tallinn](https://nfttallinn.com), Estonia May 9, 2023
  - Why go?
    - Estonia gov’t have been using blockchain for years
    - Gov’t using KSI (sp?) blockchain since 2008
    - All health records are timestamped
    - CTO and CIO of Estonian gov’t will be there
    - Bored Apes and bananas
    - 2023
      - Events for fintech, sustainability, and others
      - VIP Poker event
  - See past episode Episode 19—Reentrancy
- Estonian gov’t
  - Want to have all relevant gov’t data on blockchain and let users build apis and dapps on it
  - Near Sweden fintech, Finland gaming, Estonia – many web3 companies are coming to the region
- Where do you see the WOF labs going long-term?
  - All info gets stored on blockchain
  - Games are lightyears ahead of supply chain use case, so start there
  - Originally thought the tech was ready – tried to make a layer directly connecting suppliers and retailers
  - As we went deeper, realized finance is a language that everyone speaks – standards, but not connectivity – some using APIs, some just sending Excel spreadsheets
  - Wanted to build translators from the old ways to blockchain without impacting old workflows too much
  - Spent first year getting feedback and went to the market
  - Over the past six months, talked to about 500 stakeholders in the space. Many are already familiar with blockchain. Many tried using Hyperledger in 2017/18 and hated the experience. In the process, they learned their infrastructure needed rebuilding. COVID forced this to accelerate. Will start happening in 2-4 years on supply chain infrastructure side
  - Min 100k transactions per second at 1 cent per transaction
  - Company behind KSI blockchain
    - Works w/ US military and EU central bank
    - Building a layer-1 called AlphaBill
    - Biggest question is not the tech, but the taxonomy
    - Everyone will be “made” to collaborate in order for it to work
- Game is the place to start
