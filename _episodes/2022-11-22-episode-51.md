<!--end of quick notes-->

- On October 21, 2022 OlympusDAO lost and later recovered $292K due to an insufficient function parameter validation flaw.
  - Hack review
    - Set up another contract first
    - Exploit only used the transfer function
    - Looked up the transfer in Etherscan
    - Attack breakdown – bondexpiry contract has permission against 
      - First call robot
      - Robot Look up balance
      - Redeem something against bondexpirycontract
      - Bondexpiry calls back to expire()
      - burn() (which seems to be ignored)
        - Function requires caller to be ‘teller’ – we ran out of time and didn’t figure out how robot got teller status
      - Bondexpiry called underlying(), asked robot
      - Robot lies about underlying
      - Bond contract then performs transfer for the balance amount
    - Should not have trusted bond contract
    - Should not let underlying() be updated–it should be set at the beginning
  - = "function is broken bad, anything can happen"
  - Options: don't hack, hack and get ALL the money; non-option: hack and get some of the money
    - If you don’t, someone else will finish the job right away (everything you do on-chain is public)
    - White hat – take the money and then you have the option to give it all back
      - What difference does intentionality make? How do governments address it when someone claims they are white hats?
      - It might not be obvious where to return the money
    - No hat – If you just tell the org, maybe they will just use the exploit for their own gain
    - “Taking all the money is the only way to prevent anyone (else) from taking all the money”
    - "Taking the money is the new responsible disclosure in web3"
  - Epic heist tips (even for white hats)
    - Don’t use home computer or wifi
    - Can’t go unTOR-ed or un-VPNed even once
    - Worry about [MTG-like “fizzles”](https://mtg.fandom.com/wiki/Fizzle)
    - Upleveled OpSec is required (i.e. always using yarn in docker)
    - “This isn’t being paranoid [pause] that’s what a paranoid person would say.”
    - Anonymity buys time
