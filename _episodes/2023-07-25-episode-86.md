- How to do pharma tracking on public networks?
  - First pharma/blockchain conference from 2018: chain76org.github.io/chain76.org
- Managing physical asset tokens via claims-state tables:
  - Want to track different things (let’s call them “properties”): 
    - **Claims**: claim of ownership, claim of custody, claim of lien (1:N), claim of regulatory seizure (quarantine, destroy)
      - Vendor-managed inventory ("stays on my books until you sell it")
      - All referring to the same asset, but each have different abilities
      - Points to an agent
      - Provisions authority to do things
        - I.e. give to someone else, revoke ownership, add attribute
        - Depends on type of claim
      - Require a third party
    - **Attributes**: location/gps, temperature, humidity
      - Points to a piece of data
      - Need to be verified (perhaps by a third party)
      - Some mutable, some immutable
  - Tricky: documenting these claims, manage relationships between claims
  - “Ideally, the token space and the meat space eventually align”
  - Public, private? At least needs to be verifiable by some parties.
  - how to simultaneously handle changes in ownership, custody, liens, regulatory seizure, etc. and all of the rules between them… 
  - Prior art:
    - EIP-6464
    - Ever since Crypto Kitties, people wanted some people to be able to do stuff with NFTs while other people owned the NFTs
    - Most of this stuff is a security
  - James’ Claim States doc
  - Singleton or multiple approaches that interoperate?
  - Failure modes: lots of standards running around that don’t work together
  - Benefit: anticounterfeiting

TWEET

- Today's Community Service Hour with special guest @JamesCbury from EY.

  Discussing enterprise NFTs and how we might track ownership separately from custody in the supply chain ("Industry 4.1").

- This starts with popular concepts in #gamefi straight out of @Stepnofficial @AxieInfinity

- Then we expand this idea to enterprise supply chain applications, yes really.
