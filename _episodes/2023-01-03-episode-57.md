- Questions from @037: (https://github.com/Qumosi/QMSI/commit/27c5f472dddb02f50d680557688156404152a4af)
- Questions from @037 (misc):
  - When deploying smart contracts with no hard controls to freeze assets, etc. how can we stay compliant to AML and not face jail like Tornado cash dev Alexsey Pertsev while also ensuring users trust us with no "owner" role?
    - See episode about nothing is decentralized: episode 26
    - Don’t see regulators going after technology, but rather how it’s marketed (so far)
  - What are some modern ways to fuzz your custom smart contract code? Are there any good frameworks for security scanning contract code during runtime?
    - Smart contracts best practice is not to use fuzzing, but rather 100% test coverage
  - Are there any ex post factos to pending/future SEC regulations surrounding smart contract development? Could I get in trouble if I deploy something now and then SEC requires a control mechanism that doesn't exist and cannot be added (since smart contracts are set in stone after deploy)
    - SEC has rules but also //ask// CFTC
- Thank you for staying to the end
