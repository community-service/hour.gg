title: Platzi
subtitle: La comunidad de aprendizaje donde desarrollas tus habilidades
description: Platzi, a learning community geared towards the Spanish-speaking audience. Naty, from Platzi, sheds light on the platform's vision, fostering a sense of community beyond mere content delivery. The importance of blockchain in Latin America was underscored, given the tech and language barriers. Platzi, with its eight different schools, emphasizes hands-on experiences like hackathons. The episode also touches on the broader perspective of blockchain's reception in Latin American governments, with countries like Argentina being rather skeptical. Another key highlight is the exploration of a technical Solidity issue about exponential decay presented by @037. The overarching theme emphasizes learning through doing, with a nod to Platzi's impactful role in the tech education space.

<!--end of quick notes-->

- Interview with @NatyShi_ and @platzi

  - BS
  - Found blockchain as a way for savings, good compared to fiat then got into the "rabbit hole"! There are still language/tech barriers for the articles/guides in this space.
  - Why chemistry 
  - See blockchain + industrial in the future
  - Barriers for blockchain in Latin America
    - Documents are usually in only English
    - Technically, too difficult
  - Platzi for Spanish speaking audience, we need to share/help each other learn about tech especially b/c community is more important than the training
  - “About the community, not just the content”
  - Lots of platforms focused on financial gain, but not as many about helping
    - Retirement plans, paying for subscriptions
    - Sending money back home
    - Buying foreign subscriptions like Netflix
  - Platsy has 8 different schools
    - Blockchain school is one of tehm, run by a director
    - Also have course directors who produce content – applying best practices and help manage community
    - Creators directly produce audio-visual content
    - Not just listening to theory, also putting ideas into practice
    - Activities like challenges and hackathons for the community to participate in
    - Naty started 5 months ago, second person in the role
    - First milestone is developing an understanding of needs, the second is creating products–we’re not going to survive on bounties
    - It’s not negative to say we want to make money
    - See https://platzi.com/blog/ 
  - Will
    - In the US we see a lot of ppl moving scam investing from off-chain to on-chain
    - In latam, folks trying to *only* use blockchain for banking – getting money in and out – it’s a practical, real solution
    - Defendable honest simple approach
    - Platzi is similar to bootcamps in the US – “It’s better than learning. It’s just doing.”

- Help wanted, see our github issues

- [Delegate](https://delegate.xyz/)

  - Allows digital signing for one wallet from another wallet – for example, cold wallet at home and hot wallet on mobile phone
  - Platzi interested to teach people proper security methods
  - Naty “Freedom is linked to responsibility”
    - Low security literacy in LatAm
    - Account abstraction and delegates can be a good way to help
    - What if you die tomorrow? Relatives won’t understand what to do with a seed phrase

- Dan question “I want to hear Naty's perspective on governments in Latam and how supportive or unsupportive they are of blockchain education efforts like Platzi”

  - Argentinia has frozen banks in the bank and this may happen with custodial marketplaces and wallets
  - Current position of the government is relatively anti-crypto, but that may change with elections
  - In Brazil it’s more open. Mercadolibre has their own coin
  - It might not even include people thinking about technical topics like blockchain

- @037 (if we have extra time): Solidity issue regarding exponents; I want to derive a computation for a rewards system using negative decay but solidity doesn’t seem to work well with fraction exponents. The formula I’m looking at is 

  “*reward = reward \* e^(-1/100)*” , 

- 

  Same as “*reward = reward / e^(1/100)*” (to avoid using a negative power)
  where each time it is computed it is less than 
  what it was before (but in a manner where it can be executed as many times without exceeding its bounded limit). Euler’s number can be represented with a large uint256 (assuming no overflows and we divide it by a base number at the end so we don’t lose information) but the fraction in the exponent won’t work since 1/100 gets reduced to 0 since there are no decimals (and so e^0 is 1 and our reward stays the same after execution). Also, *e^(1/100)* is the same as *100 root (e)*, but calculating nth root seems gas expensive and not friendly towards numbers with 18 decimal places (typical ERC20 placement). 

  Some python code that simulates this:

Discussion

- Series of tokens given out, not a growth function
- Vulnerable to front-running
- Same wallet can’t click more than one
- The integral of an exponent is an integral – Not a converging number, but it doesn’t matter (because of gas costs)
- x_i = …, this is a sequence of numbers that keeps getting smaller each time (resets daily) and this will be a converging number 
- value = x_i - gas = exp(-1/100 * i)
- *****Will solves p=np\***
- This ends up looking like a linear curve, but we’ll also need to subtract the gas cost
- For practical purposes, after a few 100 retrievals this becomes unprofitable for minters
- Also look at y = 1 / 1000
- Use Excel, Python notebooks
