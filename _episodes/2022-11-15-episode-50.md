<!--end of quick notes-->

- FTX
  - Domiciled in sketchy island
  - Youth / savior complex
  - What about other exchanges?
    - Coinbase – US-based, NYSE-listed are signals of trust
    - Kucoin – Officially in Vietnam, but actually Chinese? 
  - Rush to transparency theater?
    - Whatever they do, it’s probably better than things were before
  - In 2021 all the ads looked the same – 
    - Accredited investors doing ads or just random companies
  - FTX: Don't be like Larry
  - Binance
    - Started it all by selling (or saying to do so)
    - https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1592044496174612482
    - Set up a fund for distressed assets
      - CZ gets a lot of upside from this
  - Go to DEX’s instead? Could be more transparent
    - Also lots of risk… price oracle discussion
