Guest: Neeraj of Moonsteam.to. founder of Moonstream, Neeraj, via Game7. He thinks much more deeply about how to make blockchain game economies sustainable than just about anyone I know. And they open source everything.

Neeraj’s X: https://twitter.com/zomglings

Moonstream Discord: https://discord.gg/BSxjMyfWgW

- Moonstream.to
- Want to build games that people *want* to spend their lives playing, without any dark design patterns but rather because they love it
- The first step of the metaverse is a name on a Pacman arcade machine
- Neeraj’s backgroundhttps://clashroyale.com/blog/news/community-update.html

    - Integer sequence encyclopedia
    - Neel Sloan, John Conway
  - Grandmother’s health saga inspired to help solve diagnosis issues
    - Research in Japan for a while using 
  - Always interested in tech
    - Google Tensorflow a bit

  - Can’t have Neeraj being the one person controlling wallets forever
  - Decided to decentralize everything
  - Building a reputation system 
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winning_Ways_for_Your_Mathematical_Plays
- HOw to decentralize?
  - Moonstream will probably never do a token
  - Things to avoid in decentralization
    - Transactional, financially-oriented relationships
    - Don’t want to build things that will break at scale	
  - Will wrote a paper about the game theory of this
    - Can’t avoid transactional nature of decentralized systems
    - Instead, designers have parameters to tune
    - https://medium.com/0xcert/token-curated-registries-8035d7fac2b7
- Can we build systems that scale arbitrarily?
  - Neeraj says no
  - Big tech company example
  - When community becomes too large 
  - Federation seems to work
  - Book: Driving Honda: Inside the World's Most Innovative Car Company
- Is Neeraj a game designer?
  - Maybe old school game designers are not the best for designing blockchain games
  - Want all types of game designers in teh community though
  - Cryptounicorns Minigame – designed as not fun, but players found fun and meaning in many aspects of it
- Moonstream has it’s own nodes, crawlers rather than 3rd parties
  - Could use some help on 
- I can give out Remixer NFT badges for people that completed classes before! See https://rewards.remix.ethereum.eth.limo/ how to organize this?
- Make clips
- What are some Twitch channels I should add to SUGGESTED CHANNELS?
- And who should we Twitch raid??
  - —> Day9tv

~~~ OUTPUT ~~~
With Neeraj, founder of Moonstream. We need to focus on game quality first, and then decentralize. Later we can think about scaling. And we need all types of game designers in the community.

- IDEAS:

  - ThankYou.wtf manifesto
    - What is a thank you?
      - It's public, from somebody, to somebody, and it includes a message, and some points. The points don't matter.
      - Maybe if you send ZERO points it is a message (avoid libel) it's a warning to your friends that you endorsed somebody and you don't like them any more?
      - Is this "gossip"?
      - "Soulbound FUNGIBLE tokens"
    - Why do I want a thank you?
      - Receiving a thank you can make you feel good. Good feelings increase health, longevity and quality of life.
      - Seeing thank yous from people you care about to new people can inform you if you want to be around those new people.
    - How do you send it?
      - You publish to ThankYou.wtf and blockchain using a signed message.
      - Or if you don't publish it then it sits on the ThankYou.wtf for 2 weeks. Maybe the recipient or somebody else will publish it. If nobody publishes it, the TYwtf website deletes it. If you somehow publish it directly onto a blockchain, the TYwtf website will pick it up.
    - How do you receive it? ???? DO WE WANT THIS PART? JUST HAVE THEM SEND A THANK YOU BACK?
      - You don't have to receive it.
    - Who are you sending it to?
      - Can send to a website (see Chrome list of common website domains), a specific page (twitter profile?), or a blockchain address.
    - How does the message work?
      - You type whatever you want. Up to 280 characters.
    - How do the points work?
      - You can send as many points as you want. You can make your points be any color or design. (ERC-1155.) Anybody can send themself points, they don't matter.
      - All the points (and messages) you send out to each person will show up on your page. If people care about your points the ThankYou.wtf website will also show them on the recipient's page.
      - You can send at most X points to a person at a time.
    - How is this built
      - Thank yous are signed messages like
        THANKYOU/RECIPIENT_ADDRESS_OR_HASH/POINTS/MESSAGE
      - how to do timestamps? how to revoke yourself?
      - Which blockchain do they settle on? can people repost them on other chains?
    - How can I connect my product to ThankYou.wtf?
      - You can send thank yous on chain or send to us. (Spam prevention?)
      - You can read the points, these are SBTs. And you can use them to authenticate into a website.
      - Points only go up as time goes on. But you can also calculate POWER which is some function of points and recency. You can use this power to control access to your community or help you make decisions (do we want to say voting?
    - Is there censorship / distributed?
      - You are free to use ThankYou.wtf however you like. We can censor the Thank Yous that you send to us if necessary or if it makes our product better. But we cannot censor anything you send directly to the blockchain or which you distribute in other ways.
    - What does it cost?
      - This product is free to use on ThankYou.wtf and on blockchains near you.
      - Our operating expenses are X and we received X donations. You can send thank yous to this project at Y.
      - If you would like to host your own copy of this project or maybe don't like our branding, call us. We work as consultants, call us, prices start at USD 10,000.
    - Other features
      - Email login to get notified of thank yous.
      - Browser extension to thank you any website (see Brave extension and how it find the author of any page)
    - More notes
      - Is this more like LinkedIn where have a million connections and don't even know these people, like Twitter where I might know them or just want to read them, or like my phone contacts list where these are really people I know?
      - Snap chat has streaks each day

- a) ⅓ nft generate with deploy , after that users can mint nfts in the contract at a fixed price, for example 0.01eth. Is it necessary for this to create two separate mint for us and make a public mint ? Will this greatly affect the cost of gas? or can this be solved by other functions?
  b) We use one function and we make 10k nfts at once and they will immediately get to the marketplace. What is the optimal function to use in this case for small gas?
  c) Is there a function for automatically adding a money from the nft smart contract to the liquidity pool? 
  d) is there an automatic offering for sale function (for opensea) or only external scripts? 
  e) do we have function to automatic range pricing of the nft depending on the rarity immediately in the code of the smart contract ? Thank you!!!
- [Polygon Launches Decentralized ID Service Powered By ZK Proofs - The Defiant](https://thedefiant.io/polygon-decentralized-id-service)
  - "know your" in KYC is the opposite of "zero knowledge" in ZKP
  - "“KYC requires users to provide third parties with a litany of personally-identifying information such as passports, government-issued IDs, and biometric data,”" false. KYC does not require third parties, lazy companies require third parties
  - The Defiant article seems to have overplayed the KYC aspect of this product, the original blog post at https://www.polygon.technology/polygon-id

THE TWEET

- Today's Community Service Hour focused on most sensitive topics: your money and your life.

  We looked at BioNFTs, tracking permission to use your biometrics in science studies… and KYC, tracking your eligibility to join financial transactions.

- With Bio NFTs @duribeb #BioNFT #ownyourdata ran a speed run of implementing ERC-721 NFTs with ERC-4907 rental/leasing @0xanders

- There might be a need for a similar ERC that address licenses, which are one NFT to many recipients, versus ERC-4907 which only has one exclusive recipient at a time. Study your use cases!

- Then we looked at @0xPolygon and @0xPolygonID, I love the deep long-term investment in ZK products and hires for rollups (and bridges?)

- However the ID product does not seem motivated by any real business needs. And it is especially not needed by banks/financial sector, @DefiantNews overplayed this news.

- The "know your" in KYC is the opposite of "zero knowledge" in ZKP. Not compatible!
~~~ OUTPUT ~~~
BioNFTs and how they're used to track permission for usage of biometrics is scientific studies. We also delve into the financial world and discuss KYC and it's role in keeping track of your eligibility for financial transactions.

  - Cost to be a validator increases from USD 60k to USD 4m.
  - Staking rewards become autocompounding—this is terrible, stop making this look like an interest payment!!!
  - https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/822 my response
  - There are about 800,000 ETH validators, how many do we need?

The correct way to pronounce POAP. Solidity should be better because optimizations should not be the developer's responsibility.
